Any unassigned villager could be unemployed and they could be we creating research which would let use use upgrades
We can then later have things like schools (as upgrades) which would increase the amount of research our unemployed
people create.

Since this is supposed to resemble the creation of civilizations we will keep farmer multipliers to 1 which means
that they will be producing the same amount of food that they eat, essentially being useless. This will prevent
players from assigning workers to other jobs, just like how it was in prehistory. The only time we started to have
innovation was after the start of agriculture where people started to be able to specilize in other fields and there
was a food surplus.
